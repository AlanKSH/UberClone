Warning! I made lot's of breaking changes to get all progress so far merged together.
@Ngan Your authentication and user server now runs on port 5000 and starts up with the Chat Sever and Map Positioning Server. Your ``backend/index.js`` has been renamed to ``backend/AuthServer.js`` and ``backend/db.js`` was moved to the root. The root directory imports ``server.js`` imports ``backend/AuthServer.js`` (made by Ngan), ``backend/ChatServer.js`` (made by Alan), ``backend/MapServer.js`` (made by Brad). I separated this way so we can separate out files and avoid complex merges.
@Alan Kashiwagi#4880 Your chat server is now at ``backend/ChatServer.js``
@saraaaaa#7285 I made more changes to your Map.jsx. Sorry, I'm being intrusive in your work. I tried to decouple your Map component and my MapPosition component. I have done this by exposing a ``MapPositionEmitter`` object by importing
```node.js
import MapPositionEmitter from '../MapPosition/emitter';
```
Your Map component can send the user's position to the Map Position Server this way:
```node.js
MapPositionEmitter.emit('send', {
  "long": position.coords.longitude,
  "lat": position.coords.latitude,
  "type": "rider"
});
```
And you can handle receiving positions of other users this way:
```node.js
MapPositionEmitter.on("data", (data) => {
  console.log("Position Data Received:");
  console.log(data);
})
```
You can choose how to display that information on the mapbox. The MapPosition component will handle attaching the users ID and name to their position data.
